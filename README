# Calendar Proxy

Proxy that changes calendar events in a pre-defined way

It will need:
  - a nice frontend to make it simple for the user to define how they want their events altered
    - No fancy shit. Just html, css, and js
  - a database to link unique calendar IDs,  calendar's modification, and its weblink
    - Maybe also limit the amount of requests per hour eventually?
